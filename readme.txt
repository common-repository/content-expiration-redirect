A simple plugin that lets you schedule posts or pages to expire - and where you would like the post or page to redirect to when it has expired.

== Description ==

Do you have content that you only want to show for a limited amount of time, like an event or a time-limited or one-time offer?

Don't want to worry about manually having to manage or take down your old content with expired and out of date events, outdated offers or information?

**Content Expiration & Redirect** plugin lets you schedule content to expire, and at the specified expiration date and time the content will start to redirect to a URL of your choosing. 

As soon as the WordPress post or page scheduled expiry date is reached, the content automatically starts redirecting to the URL of your choosing.
